            <div class = "col-sm"><h2>Sticker style decals</h2><br><p>Sticker style decals are fairly straightforward they're places just like stickers on the model kit, each kit's instructions has a locaiton for the decals, however the edges can be quite obvious even from a distance on these types of decals.</p></div>

            <div class = "col-sm"><h2>Dry-Transfer Decals</h2><br><p>Dry Transfer decals come on a clear sheet of plastic and must be cut out and then pressed against the model kit. The back of the decal comes off easily so its usally protexted by antistatic paper, once thats off press the back to the model kit surface. Then it is reccommended you hold the decal in place with some masking tape during this process. An example is shown below</p></div>

        <div class = "row">
            <div class = "col-sm"><p>After this is done, press down on the decal firmly and rub it, usually the handle of a hobby knife or a coin is prefered. Do this for about 30 seconds and then peel off the plastic and masking tape. The result should look like the below</p></div>

            <div class = "col-sm"><h2>Water Slide decals</h2><br><p>Water slide decals have several advantages over normal sticker style decals, the first being that the edges are not pronounced at all, the decal blends in very well with the plastic surface. The next is that they are significantly easier to line up than dry transfer decals. Lastly, they are thin enough that they can contort around irregular shapes.</p></div>
