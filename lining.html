                <div class = "col-6"><p>Gundam Markers are an easy and user friendly way to start panel lining, they come in 2 types, fine tip markers and pour type markers</p></div>
                <div class = "col-6"><p>Enamel Panel Liners are a bit trickier to use but can create beautiful results and is the reccommended technique for experienced builders</p></div>

            <div class = "col-6"> Gundam Markers are fairly plug and play. In the case of the fine tip markers simply uncap and start drawing in the lines on your pieces. Pour type markers need to be shaken and then the seal needs to be broken the first time. Once this is donepaint will flow from this marker when its pressed down, use it to gently pour the paintinto the grooves.    </div>
            <div class = "col-6">Enamel Panel Liners need a fair bit more work, Enamel paint can eat away at the plastic used for model kits. This is why its reccommended to buy a can of gloss topcoat and spray your pieces with it, more details on that can be found on the touch-up guide<a href = "touchup.html">here.</a>     </div>

        </div>
        <div class = "row">
            <div class = "col-6"> Once you've filled the grooves, use a cotton swab to wipe any excess away and you're all done!    </div>
            <div class = "col-6">  Panel line accent colours have a handy applicator in the bottle cap, use that and gently dab some at the start of the groove like in the image below, it should run accross the length of the groove by itself</div>

            <div class = "col-6">  Afterwards just clean up any excess using an enamel thinner and a q-tip, it is reccommended that you don't apply this to the bare plastic and topcoat the piece first. Enamel paint will take at least a day to dry.</div>
